 - You can read the QR with the camera app, that launches the client and you can edit the list there.
 - You can view the list of items
 - You can have boxes in boxes with each having items
 - You can reparent a box (e.g: you reparent a `shoe box` from the `gardrobe top` to the `gardrobe bottom`
 - You can edit everything in the list.
 - You can search by keywords and get the exact location of the box.
